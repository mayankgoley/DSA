#We are finding the next greater element in a monotonic decreasing stack.
# This means We pop while the current element is greater than the element at the top of the stack.
# This is useful in problems where we need to find the next greater element for each element in an array.
# This is a simple implementation of a monotonic decreasing stack.

# Example usage
arr = [5, 10, 15, 20, 4, 20, 25]
print(next_greater_element(arr))
# Output: [10, 15, 20, -1, 20, 25, -1]
# This will print the next greater element for each element in the array.
